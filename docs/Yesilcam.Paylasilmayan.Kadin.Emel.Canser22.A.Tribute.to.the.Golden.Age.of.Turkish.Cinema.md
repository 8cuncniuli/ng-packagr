YeÅilÃ§am, which literally means "Green Pine" in Turkish, is a metonym for the Turkish film industry, similar to Hollywood in the United States. YeÅilÃ§am is named after YeÅilÃ§am Street in the BeyoÄlu district of Istanbul where many actors, directors, crew members and studios were based[^6^]. YeÅilÃ§am produced hundreds of films every year in various genres such as melodrama, comedy, romance, thriller and musical. YeÅilÃ§am films reflected the social and cultural changes in Turkey as well as the aspirations and dreams of the Turkish people.
 
Emel Canser was one of the most prominent and provocative stars of YeÅilÃ§am. She was born in 1950 in Ankara and started her career as a model. She made her film debut in 1970 and soon became known for her bold and sensual roles. She appeared in more than 50 films, mostly in erotic dramas that challenged the conservative norms of Turkish society. She was also a singer and released several albums. She died in 1986 at the age of 36 from cancer.
 
PaylaÅÄ±lmayan KadÄ±n (The Woman Who Was Not Shared) is a 1976 film directed by Yavuz Figenli and starring Emel Canser, Mahmut Cevher and Nuri Yurter. The film tells the story of a wealthy businessman who falls in love with a young woman who works as a dancer at a nightclub. He marries her but soon becomes obsessed with her fidelity and tries to control her every move. The film was a box office hit and received mixed reviews from critics.
